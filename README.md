# task
This is not fully done project. But here is the the way how I would solve it.
So, to complete this task we need to start our search from the / dirrectory, as stipulated in conditions;
by searching the app will be writing it's way to guide after.
The way of search should be written in array and by command if app dosen't find anythyng it must search next dirrectory.
Finally, if there is no way then there is no such a file.
